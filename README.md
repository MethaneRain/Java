# Java
Java based projects; need to learn some new stuff!!

It is tough starting over with a new language, but I really need/want to.

I'd really like to eventually get into using Node.js, or Vue.js, etc. These frameworks will allow me to venture into the webpage realm of coding and even the visualization. With this I hope to absorb some HTML and CSS coding as well.

But like anything in life, one must learn to crawl be web-crawl... :/ bad joke
