Welcome to my beginners Java knock-off of Wheel of Fortune!

It's a pretty simple, in the command line run:
```java WoF.java name1 name2 name3```

This will initiate the game in the terminal with 3 players. There will be crude instructions for each player as to what their choices are. The puzzles are different atmospheric phenomena, give it a try and hope you have some fun!
