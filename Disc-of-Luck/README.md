As yes, the classic Disc of Luck game!

Of course the inspiration here is the Wheel of Fortune(c) game.

My first programming language was Python and my first major project in Python was a very crude and clunky Wheel of Fortune-esq game. Since I am trying to grab a working on-the-fly knowledge of Java, I figured this would be another great project to test my basic Java knowledge!

<font size=16>There are numerous aspects of this game that I needed to stitch together and it has been challenging and fun.</font>
